        Angels and Eagles Art Gallery features the art of Moore County North Carolina artist and resident "Mickeyangelo." Amazingly it is all created by hand and becomes more facinating the longer you look at it. Camoflaged and hidden in some of his "expressions" are fun discoveries you probably will not see at first glance. Some of the pieces have been born through design ideas for carving, painting and sculpting over many years of time. Others have been captured in journals and written down awaiting their turn to become reality.

   Each piece of ART is inspired by a person and encounter that carved a memory on the soul of the artist. His stories are as unique and fascinating as the Angels and Eagles he has created.
